Online School AI aims to make Online School as easy as possible

Generally the approach that I take when cheating on a writing assignment is going to Claude/chatgpt

Then typing in a prompt to complete an assignment

After getting the assigment I will proofread it, then send it to undetectible AO

From their I will use grammarly to correct any spelling errors and then run it through all ai detection devices
for a final time then I will have the final assignment ready to submit


One main class to control the web server 
One master class for controlling the input and output
One class to submit a prompt
One class for Claude 2
One class for Undetectible AI
One class for Grammarly
One class for AI detection
